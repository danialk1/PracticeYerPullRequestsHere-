# PracticeYerPullRequestsHere-
Hello Everyone. This is just to get a little practice using git for the basics.
We'll figure out and work on the other things when they come along, but this should get you started.

Instructions:
1. Clone this repository (repo) into your IDE.
2. Edit data.txt per the instructions
3. create a new file (in the "newfiles" folder/directory with your first name as the title. For me, I would create "bryan.txt".
4. In that file, type something. If you don't know what to type, type "I'm ready for calhacks!"
5. Commit your changes onto a seperate branch with your name as the branch. Push it if needed. DO NOT COMMIT/PUSH DIRECTLY TO MASTER.
6. Make a pull request. A pull request merges the branch you have made with the Master branch.
7. I will approve the pull request. After I approve it confirm the merging of the branches.
8. You're good to go! Note that, afaik, during the actual calhacks everyone will have access
    and will not need to wait for me to approve of the pull request.
